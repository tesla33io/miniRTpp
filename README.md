# miniRTpp

> A lightweight ray tracing engine in C++ powered by Vulkan.

**miniRTpp** is an enhanced and expanded version of the 42 miniRT project, with the potential to evolve into a comprehensive 42 RT project.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a ray tracing engine capable of rendering high-quality images of 3D scenes.
This project draws inspiration from the 42 miniRT and RT projects, aiming to push the boundaries of visual fidelity and performance in real-time rendering.
